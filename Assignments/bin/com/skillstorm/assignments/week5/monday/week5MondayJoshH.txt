1. List 3 coding conventions you are good at following already.
	- I have the order of class declarations down pretty well now.
	- Only using one declaration per line, and initializing local variables where they're declared unless
		the value depends on a computation happening first.
	- Naming conventions.

2. List 3 coding conventions you will start using more consistently while programming.
	- Declaring class(static) variables before instance variables in the order of class declaration.
	- Avoiding lines longer than 80 characters, and following wrapping conventions for expressions.
	- Avoiding hard-coding numerical values and constants directly when they should be stored in a variable.

3. Why is it important to follow coding conventions and write clean code?
	- If anyone else will read or use the code, you would want it to be as easy to read as possible.
	- If the codebase will be used for a long time, it will make it easier to come back to and maintain.
