Week 4 - Wednesday Polymorphism
Joshua Holland
-------------------------------------------------
Problem 1
1. No
2. N/A
3. The Rose smell() method won't be able to access the encapsulated properties marked as private in the parent class without the use of getter and setter methods.
4. Method overriding (runtime polymorphism) in the case of the Rose class overriding the  smell() method.
-------------------------------------------------
Problem 2
1. No
2. N/A
3. Can't store a Flower object in a Rose variable unless you explicitly typecast it as a Rose.
4. Also comile-time in the case of the smell() method being overridden. You could maybe argue that in the case of the different constructors, we're using Method overloading (compile-time polymorphism).
