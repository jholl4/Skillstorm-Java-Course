1. What types of questions were the hardest for you? Give the problem number for one of them. Which Test objective does it fall under?
	- Lambda Expressions...not something that has been covered during lecture yet. Questions 43 and 52.

2. What was a question you got right, but when you read the solution, you realized your reasoning was off? (Give the problem number and explanation.)
	- Question 24. I picked the opposite of the obvious answer and got it right, but I didn't fully understand how the order of assignment in the problem worked. The explanation has cleared that up for me!

3. Find one resource for learning more about the topic you struggled on such as method overloading https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/overriding-vs-overloading-in-javaLinks to an external site. and put the link here. It is recommended you also share the link with your classmates.
	- I recently found this channel called Coding with John on youtube and really like his succinct explanations of coding topics. Here's his video on Lambda expressions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj5sLSFjVj4&t=10s
