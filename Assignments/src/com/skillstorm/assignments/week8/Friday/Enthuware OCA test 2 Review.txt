1. What types of questions were the hardest for you? Give the problem number for one of them. Which Test objective does it fall under?
	- There were some tricky questions on working with inheritance...question 6 for example.

2. What was a question you got right, but when you read the solution, you realized your reasoning was off? (Give the problem number and explanation.)
	- Question 28. I wasn't 100% sure if the Boolean class has a string constructor.

3. Find one resource for learning more about the topic you struggled on such as method overloading https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/overriding-vs-overloading-in-javaLinks to an external site. and put the link here. It is recommended you also share the link with your classmates.
	- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inheritance-in-java/# is what I'm currently reading to better understand inheritance. I feel that I understand it fairly well but there have been some edge cases that tend to slip past my notice. I did realize that on test 2 question 6, the fact that I was missing is that the location field in Donkey doesn't have an access modifier, which makes it package private. When you print m.location, you are trying to access the field from outside of the package(accessing it directly from main). Since it's package private in Donkey, and interface fields are implicitly public static final, that is why the interface's location field is accessed.
