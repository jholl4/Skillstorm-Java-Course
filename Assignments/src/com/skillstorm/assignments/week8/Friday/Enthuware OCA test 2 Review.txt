1. What types of questions were the hardest for you? Give the problem number for one of them. Which Test objective does it fall under?
	- There were some tricky questions on working with inheritance...question 6 for example.

2. What was a question you got right, but when you read the solution, you realized your reasoning was off? (Give the problem number and explanation.)
	- Question 28. I wasn't 100% sure if the Boolean class has a string constructor.

3. Find one resource for learning more about the topic you struggled on such as method overloading https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/overriding-vs-overloading-in-javaLinks to an external site. and put the link here. It is recommended you also share the link with your classmates.
	- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inheritance-in-java/# is what I'm currently reading to better understand inheritance. I feel that I understand it fairly well but there have been some edge cases that tend to slip past my notice. I still don't fully understand why System.out.println(m.location) in the main method of question 6 accesses the location field of the interface and not the instance field of the m Donkey object.
