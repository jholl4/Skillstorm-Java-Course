1. What types of questions were the hardest for you? Give the problem number for one of them. Which Test objective does it fall under?

	- I have a bit of a weak point with data type and method objective questions. Question 12, it slipped past me that the method to
	increment the i variable never actually ASSIGNED the new value to the variable. I also did not fully understand the "pass by value"
	nature of passing an array object into a method actually points to the same array object via its memory address, so that its value
	WAS modified outside of the called method. Definitely something I need to spend some more time with.

2. What was a question you got right, but when you read the solution, you realized your reasoning was off? (Give the problem number and explanation.)

	- Question 7; one of the correct answers involved initializing static variables in a static block to ensure that they are initialized
	even when no instance of the class is created. I hadn't seen this use of a static block before, but I used process-of-elimination to 
	narrow that down as one of the answers.

3. Find one resource for learning more about the topic you struggled on such as method overloading https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/overriding-vs-overloading-in-javaLinks to an external site. and put the link here. It is recommended you also share the link with your classmates.

	- I've been having a hard time wrapping my head around the concept of 'pass by value' and this article has helped me improve my 
	level of understanding: https://www.javatpoint.com/java-pass-by-value
