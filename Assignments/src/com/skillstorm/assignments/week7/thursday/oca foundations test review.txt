1. What types of questions were the hardest for you? Give the problem number for one of them. Which Test objective does it fall under?

	- I struggled with the questions involving working with Java-s Date-Time API. Question 25, 68 and 76. Some of the deatils I had partially correct, but it was definitely a gap in my knowledge.

2. What was a question you got right, but when you read the solution, you realized your reasoning was off? (Give the problem number and explanation.)

	- Question 35. I got lucky on this one due to an educated guess and process of elimination...did not know about the predicate interface until reviewing this test!

3. Find one resource for learning more about the topic you struggled on such as method overloading https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/overriding-vs-overloading-in-javaLinks to an external site. and put the link here. It is recommended you also share the link with your classmates.

	- I found this video nice as an intro to the Date-Time API: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XgdX5hDL4U
